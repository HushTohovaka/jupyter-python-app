Python Machine Learning Process
- Import the Data. (This can come in many ways)
- Clean the data. (Fix problems, add data to missing columns etc)
- Split the data into two sets. (Training and Testing) 
- Create a model , Use built in algorithms. Eg. this could be decision trees.  
- Train the model
- Make Predictions - These can often be inaccurate so we need to ensure 
- Evaluate and Improve the model as the evaluations can be wrong. 


Libraries (Popular)
- numpy (multi dimensions arrays)
- pandas (data frames, rows and columns)
- MatPlotLib (IGraphs and Plots)
- SciKit-Learn (Algorithms like decision trees)


Using Jupyter
- Using Anaconda (Used Anaconda )
- Makes it easier to inspect data.


Starting the notebook server
- Command in terminal to start *** jupyter notebook
- This needs to be completed inside the anaconda prompt terminal


Download a data set
- Kaggle.com 


Pandas Data Frames Project
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('vgsales.csv')
df.shape


Shortcuts 
- You can use H to show all the shortcuts that can be used in jupyter
- A will create a row above. B will create a row Below
- There is also intellisense so you can use tab to see what methods are available to use.
